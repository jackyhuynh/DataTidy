## 1. Sampling

Sampling is a critical technique used to select a representative subset of data for analysis when processing all the
data is not feasible.

### Key Concepts:

- **Statistical Significance**: Ensure the sample represents the population accurately to avoid bias.
- **Avoid Bias**: Understand the data source and select a sample that represents the entire population.
- **Types of Sampling**:
    - **Progressive Sampling**: Incrementally increase the sample size until a satisfactory level of statistical
      significance is reached.
    - **Backed Test Biases**: Use historical data to evaluate how well a model will perform in the future.

## 2. Feature Selection

Feature selection involves selecting a subset of the most relevant features (attributes/variables) from the dataset to
improve the performance of machine learning algorithms.

### Techniques:

- **Embedded Feature Selection**: Naturally occurs within the algorithm, such as in Decision Trees.
- **Filter-Based**: Features are selected based on statistical properties before running the model, e.g.,
  Correlation-Based Feature Selection.
- **Wrapper-Based**: Uses a machine learning model as a black box to evaluate different combinations of features, e.g.,
  Brute Force Feature Selection.

### Why Feature Selection?

- **Improved Model Performance**: Reduces the dimensionality of the dataset, leading to faster and more efficient
  algorithms.
- **Redundancy Removal**: Eliminate duplicate or irrelevant features that don’t contribute meaningful information.

---

## 3. Dimensionality Reduction

Dimensionality reduction involves reducing the number of features in a dataset while retaining essential information.
This is especially important for large datasets with many variables.

### Benefits:

- **Improved Clustering**: Reduces data sparsity, making it easier to apply clustering algorithms and meaningful
  distance measures.
- **Simplified Models**: Simplifies models by removing irrelevant or redundant features.

---

## 4. Data Tidying

Data tidying is the process of organizing and structuring data so that it is consistent and easy to analyze. According
to the **tidy data principles**:

- **Each variable forms a column**.
- **Each observation forms a row**.
- **Each type of observational unit forms a table**.

### Importance:

- **Improved Efficiency**: Clean and well-structured data makes analysis easier and more reliable.
- **Consistency**: Ensures consistency across datasets, allowing easier manipulation and transformation.

---

## 5. Attribute Confirmation

Attribute confirmation ensures the reliability of the dataset’s attributes through various statistical measures:

- **Z-Score Normalization**: Standardizes features before applying techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or
  distance measures.
- **Statistical Measures**: Mean, Standard Deviation, and Z-scores can help identify outliers and ensure the dataset is
  ready for modeling.

---

## 6. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA is essential for understanding the structure and distribution of the data before applying models. It involves:

- Summarizing the data’s main characteristics.
- Using data visualization tools such as **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for graphical representation.
